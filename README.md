This is the repository for the course project of course CS587 (Purdue CS, Spring '24) titled: *Comparison Between Few-Shot Learning and Knowledge Distillation*.

The folders consist of the scripts to run training and inference of individual methods that we experimented in the project such as knowledge distillation, few-shot learning and training some baseline models. We performed all the experiments with the PathMNIST dataset with Pytorch framework.

Install medmnist using the following:
